HeartPaws is a website where you can either give a pet up for adoption or adopt one. If you have a pet you can't care for anymore, you fill out a form. The admin then decides if they can put your pet on HeartPaws. If approved, they'll request you to bring the pet to an adoption center.

If you want to adopt a pet, you fill out a form with your details. The admin reviews all requests and selects the most suitable adopter. Once an adopter is chosen, the other requests are deleted, and the pet is taken off HeartPaws. The admin maintains a record of the pet and the new owner's contact information.

HeartPaws makes it easy to find new homes for pets and connect them with loving adopters.
